# Tasks: Remove Demo Output Directory Code Path

**Purpose**: Clean up unused demo-quality-injection.py script and demo_output directory that are no longer needed.

**Context**: The `demo_output/` directory contains static demo data generated by `scripts/demo-quality-injection.py`. This script was used for demonstrating quality injection features but is no longer actively maintained or used in the current workflow.

## Phase 1: Cleanup Tasks

- [ ] T001 Review demo-quality-injection.py script in scripts/demo-quality-injection.py to confirm it's the only code writing to demo_output/
- [ ] T002 Search codebase for any references to demo_output directory
- [ ] T003 Delete scripts/demo-quality-injection.py script
- [ ] T004 Verify demo_output/ is already in .gitignore (line 62)
- [ ] T005 Update .specify/memory/constitution.md if it references demo_output/ (line 82)
- [ ] T006 Manually delete demo_output/ directory from local filesystem (optional - already gitignored)
- [ ] T007 Run tests to ensure no dependencies on removed script
- [ ] T008 Update README.md or documentation if demo script was referenced

## Execution Order

1. T001 (review) → T002 (search references)
2. T003-T005 can run in parallel after T002
3. T006-T007 after deletions complete
4. T008 final documentation update

## Validation

After completion:
- [ ] `scripts/demo-quality-injection.py` should not exist
- [ ] No code references `demo_output/` except .gitignore and constitution.md (historical reference)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No broken imports or missing dependencies
